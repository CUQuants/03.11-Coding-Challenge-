CU Quants Club - 03.11 Coding Challenge

Basic Stock Returns and Risk Analysis

Overview

This challenge is designed to help CU Quants members practice key concepts in quantitative finance, specifically risk and return analysis. Participants will work with stock price data to calculate daily returns, evaluate risk, and determine the best stock to invest in using the Sharpe ratio.

Task Breakdown

Calculate Daily Returns: Implement a function to compute daily percentage returns from stock prices.

Compute Sharpe Ratio: Calculate key risk and return metrics, including average daily return, standard deviation (risk), annualized return and risk, and the Sharpe ratio.

Identify the Best Stock: Find the stock with the highest Sharpe ratio.

Match Expected Output: Ensure that your output matches the provided expected results exactly.

Compare with Solutions: Once completed, compare your results with the provided solutions to check for accuracy and alternative approaches.

Requirements

Use only NumPy and Pandas libraries.

All stock price data is provided in the template (no need for external data sources).

Follow the instructions in the TODO comments within the code template.

Evaluation Criteria

Your solution will be assessed based on:

Correctness: Properly implemented calculations.

Output Accuracy: Results must match the expected output precisely.

Code Clarity & Organization: Readable and well-structured code.
